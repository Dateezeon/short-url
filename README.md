### Dev Process

I wan't to use as few libraries as possible for customization, all of which I am very familiar with.

React-Bootstrap - I wan't some basic UI components that would allow easy customization.
Styled-Components - Big fan of this library and having all style in the same file as the component.
Playwright - Been using this recently over react-testing-library.  Runs headlessly in multiple browsers.
